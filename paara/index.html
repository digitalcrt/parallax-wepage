        <hr>
        <p>
            Dhanushkodi, the very last stoppage of India, is also famous as the starting point of Rama Setu. 
            Rameshwaram temple records say that Rama Setu or Rama Bridge was entirely above sea level until it got damaged in 1480.
             Many of us think that Rameshwaram is the last land of India. And you know, what the irony is – I thought the same until I went there!

            After a massive cyclone in 1964, the Government labeled it as ‘not fit for human habitation’, and because of the town’s remote location and its past, 
            Dhanushkodi is referred to as the ‘Ghost Town’.</p>
